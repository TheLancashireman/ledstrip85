# ledstrip85

RGB led strip controller using an attiny85 microcontroller.

Several modes - constant, fading, pseudo-random, ...

Infra-red remote control input.

The timing in this sketch uses the tinylib timing on Timer0.

The project uses the libraries from tiny-bare-metal.
No arduino libraries were harmed during the construction of this application. :-)

The project was derived from the original ledstrip sketch for an Arduino nano.
